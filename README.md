# Zabbix-Zerto-Monitoring
This is a fork of the template, [Zerto Replication VPG monitoring for vSphere](https://share.zabbix.com/virtualization/zerto-replication-vpg-monitoring-for-vsphere), found on Zabbix share. Please reference the original share for installation instructions.

## Changes
### Adding Sub Status's
The major change on this template from the original is adding Sub Status's from Zerto to decrease false alarms for sites that have frequent large delta changes.
